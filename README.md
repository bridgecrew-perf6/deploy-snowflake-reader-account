# Deploying A Snowflake Reader Account

## Overview

Snowflake reader accounts enable data providers to share data with consumers who are not already Snowflake customers and without requiring those consumers to become Snowflake customers in a separate "read-only" account.

## Usage

Each sub-directory contains a Snowflake reader account deployment process. These processes can (and should!) be used to automate the creation of Snowflake reader accounts for the purposes of sharing data between the primary (provider) account and any secondary (consumer) accounts.

Follow the `README` in each directory for setup and configuration.
